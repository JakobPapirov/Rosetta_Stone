This repo will contain programs translated into multiple programming languages.

## Hello World
The "hello world!" program.

## basicMath
In this program the user is asked for his/hers name, if the input is blank ("") then a default name if set.
The user is asked to input one number, then another and finally is asked to sum the two numbers given.
If the user answers correctly, they'll be greeted by a "well done"-message. If not correct, then a "Incorrect"-message will display as well as the correct answer.

# When time permits I'll use this in a WebDev project.
